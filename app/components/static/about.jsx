      I started my journey into tech not through formal academia, but through curiosity and grit. While studying procurement and supply chain management, I kept gravitating toward systems — how things worked, how they could be automated, and how teams could operate more efficiently with the right tools. That curiosity led me to web development, where I found the perfect intersection of logic, creativity, and impact.

      Today, I'm a frontend-focused software engineer with a growing full-stack skill set. I’ve designed and built internal tools for startups, including a real-time payroll and attendance tracking system, a dynamic company blog platform, and a peer-to-peer currency exchange app with real-time pricing updates and secure payments. These projects taught me not only how to write maintainable code, but how to solve real problems for real users.

      What drives me is building products that are fast, accessible, and reliable — whether that’s a tool for internal operations or a consumer-facing web app. I’m comfortable working with React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I thrive in collaborative, agile teams where ideas move fast and ownership is shared.

      I’m currently looking for opportunities to grow as a frontend engineer in a high-impact startup or fintech environment — especially teams that value clean design, fast iteration, and user-first thinking.

      If that sounds like you, let’s talk.
