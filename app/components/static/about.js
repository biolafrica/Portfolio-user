    <h5 className="about-text">

      I started my journey into tech not through formal academia, but through curiosity and grit. While studying procurement and supply chain management, I kept gravitating toward how things worked, how they could be automated, and how teams could operate more efficiently with the right tools. That curiosity led me to web development, where I found the perfect intersection of logic, creativity, and impact.<br/><br/>

      Today, I'm a frontend-focused software engineer with a growing full-stack skill set. I&lsquo;ve designed and built internal tools for startups, including a real-time payroll and attendance tracking system, a dynamic company blog platform, and a peer-to-peer currency exchange app with real-time pricing updates and secure payments. These projects taught me not only how to write maintainable code, but how to solve real problems for real users.<br/><br/>

      What drives me is building products that are fast, accessible, and reliable, whether that&lsquo;s a tool for internal operations or a consumer-facing web app. I&lsquo;m comfortable working with React, Next.js, Node.js, Supabase, Firebase and MongoDB, and I thrive in collaborative, agile teams where ideas move fast and ownership is shared.<br/><br/>

      I&lsquo;m currently open to opportunities to grow as a frontend engineer in a high-impact tech company, especially teams that value clean design, fast iteration, and user-first thinking.

      If that sounds like you, let&lsquo;s talk.
